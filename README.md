# Examination System üìÉ‚úíÔ∏è‚úÖ

The main objective of this examination system is to automate the random generation of exams, performing them online and correcting them based on model answers.
It was designed and constructed using **MySQLServer database and C# EntityFramework Core.**


Instructors can choose how many models of the exam to be generated on each course topic.
They can choose the format of the exam, number of MCQ, True or False and Essay Questions on each course topic.
They can also track how many students took the exam and how well they did based on a mark-percentage grading system.


Students can take the exam online with all randomly-set questions appearing one after one with their potential answers.
They can check the remaining time of the exam online before it no longer accepts answer submissions.
They can also see the results right after the answers are submitted and may check which answers were correct or wrong.
